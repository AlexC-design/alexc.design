Now that I have a clearer understanding of React, I tried to apply all of the lessons I've learned while building previous projects and to focus more on best practices and paying more attention to the structuring of the code. I plan on expanding it further the more projects I build and the better I become when it comes to Web Development."

  {
    paragraph:
      "When building the project, I've encountered a problem. To be able to zoom on images, I tried to use Sirv, the hosting service I used for the images, by pulling in a script they provided. The script made changes to the DOM and this, in turn, caused React to crash. This was because React was trying to perform an action on an element that had been moved from its place by the script, and it could no longer find it."
  },

    paragraph:
      "A temporary solution I found was to change the logic in my application to avoid the error. This does mean that I am not able to use a feature of the website that I really liked, but I am working on finding a way to fix the issue and bring back the feature."
